# PART3 - Drawing loaded map

this part is also kind off simple since we impliment automap
this is not like doom does its only as a proof of concept really

to convert 2D data to 2D image only need to know lines are walls and vertices are corners

need to add the min max X and Y  in the addVertex and also in Map class

added the function renderAutoMap in the map class, this is the part where it draw lines
